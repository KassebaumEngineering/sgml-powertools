* Introduction

GlossTeX is a tool for the automatic preparation of glossaries, lists
of acronyms and sorted lists in general for use with LaTeX and
MakeIndex. In order to build GlossTeX, you need an ANSI C
compiler.

GlossTeX in some kind combines the functionality of acronym, nomencl
and GloTeX. Like GloTeX, it uses the same format glossary definition
files. GlossTeX can be used together with nomencl, nevertheless.

A term consists of a label which is used to identify it, an optional
typeset representation, an optional long-form (e.g. when it's an
acronym) and the actual text describing it. These elements can all be
accessed in several ways within the document. It is also possible to
place cross-references from one term to another and include
page-references into the produced lists. You can produce as many
independent lists as you like.

The most recent version can be found on CTAN:/support/glosstex. Note
that there are also binaries in the binaries subdirectory (currently
only OS/2 -- any volunteers?).

GlossTeX comes with absolutely no warranty and is covered by the GNU
General Public License (see the file COPYING).

* Usage

In your LaTeX-source, type:

	\documentclass{article}
	\usepackage{glosstex}
	\begin{document}

	\printglosstex(acr)
	This document is typeset using \gls{LaTeX}.

	The database file\glosstex{gdf-file} for use with
	\gls{GlossTeX} is a flat \ac{ASCII} file.

	\printglosstex(glo)
	\end{document}

You need a .gdf-file that contains the definitions of the terms you
want to appear in the glossary. For example:

	@entry{LaTeX, \LaTeX{}} \LaTeX{} is a \TeX{}-format.

	@entry{ASCII, ASCII, American Standard Code for Information
	Interchange} ASCII is a character encoding. See also
	\glxref{EBCDIC}.

You then run latex, glosstex, makeindex and latex again to build the
glossary. It may be necessary to use up to 4 iterations until all
references are resolved.


* Building and Installation 

First, you need to build glosstex from its C sources. If you have
MAKE, typing "make" from the shell should build the binary (have a
look at the various makefiles, namely "Makefile", "Makefile.unx"
(which is the most generic one) and "Makefile.os2"). If you don't have
make just issue these commands:

     cc -c database.c -o database.o
     cc -c error.c -o error.o
     cc -c labels.c -o labels.o
     cc -c list.c -o list.o
     cc -c main.c -o main.o
     cc -c version.c -o version.o
     cc database.o error.o labels.o list.o main.o version.o  -o glosstex

Then put the binary "glosstex" -- or "glosstex.exe" -- somewhere in
your path.

Now you have to unpack glosstex.dtx. To get the package, run

	latex glosstex.ins

and follow the directions. 

To build the documentation, just type "make doc", or alternatively a
few times:

	latex glosstex.dtx
	glosstex glosstex glosstex
	makeindex glosstex.gxs -o glosstex.glx -t glosstex.glg -s glosstex.mst
	latex glosstex.dtx

If something goes wrong, watch glosstex.log or glosstex's log-file
"glosstex.gxg" and MakeIndex' log-file "glosstex.glg".

If everthing works fine, you have the complete documentation and
documented LaTeX-soure in glosstex.dvi.

* Binaries

Have a look in CTAN:/support/glosstex/binaries/os2 where you can find a
complete package of GlossTeX including binaries for OS/2.
