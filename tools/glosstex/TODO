* BUGS

** the endmark \glosstexpage := \hfill\page doesn't work reliably. see
   thmmarks.sty (I can't seem to find it) and ntheorem.sty for a
   better solution.

* TODO

** call MakeIndex from within GlossTeX with exec(). Should also work
   with DOS (process.h instead of unistd.h in UNIX). name of MakeIndex
   binary should be configureable. in DOS, it's called makeindx,
   AFAIK.

** some path searching functionality to find .gdf-files and .mst files
   (in combination with the above)

** include a test-suite with files foo.glx.expect to be able to test
   each version whether it's still fully functional.

* MAYBE

** include functionality of nomencl, à la include references produced
   by \ref and not only \pageref, or eq-ref. problem: too much
   features. it's not easy to deterimine the environment were're
   currently in.

** \newcommand{\glosstexgroup} for use with lethead_prefix in
   MakeIndex, similar to \nomgroup. not really necessary.

** each list can produce independent lists on
   part/chapter/section-level. problem: hard to implement, featurism,
   not really necessary.

* DONE
