*** This is the README file for the sgml-powertools package, version 0.1 

This work was derived from the excellent SGML-Tools by Cees de Groot which was originally created by Matt Welsh, and maintained by Greg Hankins under the name Linuxdoc-SGML.  Please see the README for sgml-tools for more information. 

Enjoy!
