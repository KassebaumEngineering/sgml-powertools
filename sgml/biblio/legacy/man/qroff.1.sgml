<sect1> NAME
qroff &mdash translate a <tt/groff ms/ file into ASCII

<sect1> SYNOPSIS

<p>
<verb>
format -T nroff file | qroff [-b <sgml bibliography>] 
format -T grops file | qroff -p [-b <sgml bibliography>] | lpr
</verb>

<sect1> DESCRIPTION

<p><tt/qroff/ is a greatly simplified front end to <tt/groff/ and
<tt/grefer/.  Its primary purpose is to generate formatted <tt/ASCII/
versions of <tt/qwertz/ SGML documents suitable, e.g., for electronic
messages.  However, it may also be used as an alternative to &LaTeX
for printing the document.  Some may prefer <tt/groff/'s layout style.
(Unfortunately, <tt/groff/ does not support cross-references, so if
you use these, you will need to &LaTeX;.)

<p><tt/qroff/ only reads from the standard input; it is designed to be
used in a pipe, as in the examples in the synopsis, above.  

<sect1> OPTIONS

<p><descrip>
<tag><tt/-help/

<p> If this is the only option, a short message listing all the
options available, and their purpose, is printed to the standard out.

<tag><tt/-p/

<p>Create a PostScript file, instead of <tt/ASCII/.

<tag><tt/-b &lt;sgml bibliography>/

<p>If the document contains a list of references, you will need to use
this option to provide the name of the file containing the
bibliography, which must be in the format defined in the <tt/biblo/
document type definition.  See also <tt/biblio (1)/.
