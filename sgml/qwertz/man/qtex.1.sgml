<sect1> NAME
qtex &mdash translate a &LaTeX file into PostScript

<sect1> SYNOPSIS

<p>
<verb>
qtex [-dsxgbvc] file[.tex] | lpr
cat file.tex | qtex [-dsxgbvc] | lpr
</verb>

<sect1> DESCRIPTION

<p> <tt/qtex/ is a front-end to &LaTeX;, Bib&TeX and a <tt/dvi/ to
PostScript driver, which makes them considerably easier, and more
Unix-like, to use.  Unlike &LaTeX;, it can also process &LaTeX files
read from the standard input file, or in a Unix pipe.  By default,
<tt/qtex/ writes PostScript to the standard output file, but there is
a command line switch, described below, for generating the usual &TeX
<tt/dvi/ file instead.   The ".tex" file extension is optional.  If
&LaTeX finds an error in your input file, a message will be printed to
the standard error file and execution is terminated, with a non-zero
exit status.   There will be a ".log" file in the same directory as
the input file describing the errors.

<sect1> OPTIONS

<p><descrip>
<tag><tt>-help</>

<p>If this is the only option, a short message listing all the
options available, and their purpose, is printed to the standard out.

<tag><tt/-d/

<p>Create a &TeX device-independent file, i.e. a <tt/dvi/ file,
instead of PostScript.  This is piped to the standard output
file.  To save the <tt/dvi/ file, write, for example:

<verb>
qtex -d foo > foo.dvi
</verb>

<tag><tt>-s</>

<p><em>Save</> all temporary files, such as <tt>foo.tex</>,
<tt>foo.dvi</>, and <tt>foo.aux</>.   PostScript is generated and
written to standard out as usual.

<tag><tt>-x</>

<p>Use this option if the input file contains <em>cross
references</>.  This option causes the &LaTeX file to be processed by
&TeX twice, to resolve the references.

<tag><tt>-g</>

<p>Use this option if the document is written in <em/German/.  It
causes &TeX to use another algorithm for hyphenation.  Remember to
<em>also</> use the <tt>german</> option in the options list of the
document itself. 

<tag><tt>-b</>

<p>Use this option if the file includes a list of references or
<em>bibliography</>.  The option causes &LaTeX;, then Bib&TeX and then
&LaTeX (twice) again to be run.   The bibliography referenced in the
document is expected to be a Bib&TeX <tt/bib/ file in the same
directory as the document.   If your bibliography is being
maintained in the <tt/biblio/ SGML format, use the <tt/biblio/
command to first translate it into <tt/bib/ format.  The <tt/-b/
option implies the <tt/-x/ option, for cross-references, described above.

<tag><tt>-v</>

<p><em>Verbose</> mode.  If your document is particularly long, you
may want to use this mode to be kept posted about just what
<tt>qtex</> is doing at the moment.  The messages are written to
standard error, so that they are not mixed with the PostScript being
piped to the printer!

<tag><tt/-c/

<p>To process a single chapter or section not containing the necessary
&LaTeX header (i.e. the <tt/&bsol;documentstyle/ and <tt/&bsol;begin{document}/
commands), use this option.  They will be added to the file before it
is processed by &TeX;   This option is necessary  when
formatting a &LaTeX chapter or section generated from SGML using the
<tt/format/ command.
