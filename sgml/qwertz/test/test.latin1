          The  qwertz document types are a set of Standard Generalized
          Markup Language (SGML) document type definitions (DTDs)  for
          articles,  reports,  books, letters, notes, slides (or over­
          head  transparencies),  bibliographies,  and  manual  pages.
          Except  for manual pages, the document types have been heav­
          ily influenced by the LaTeX document types of the same names
          Lamport86  ,  so  LaTeX  users  should  feel  right at home.
          Indeed, we presently translate most  qwertz  documents  into
          LaTeX  for printing and the LaTeX produced is quite readable
          by anyone familiar with LaTeX.

             When may it be necessary to use of an entity reference to
          produce some character?  There are three cases to watch  out
          for:


             SSGGMMLL CCoonnccrreettee SSyynnttaaxx DDeelliimmiitteerrss..
                Although the SGML standard allows alternative concrete
                syntaxes to be defined, we use the so-called _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
                _c_o_n_c_r_e_t_e _s_y_n_t_a_x in the qwertz document types.  ...


             SSGGMMLL SShhoorrtt RReeffeerreennccee DDeelliimmiitteerrss..
                In  SGML  document  types  _s_h_o_r_t _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _m_a_p_s may be
                defined which allow single  characters  to  be  inter­
                preted as arbitrarily complex sequences of characters,
                including SGML tags and entity references. ...


                " # % ' ( ) * + , - : ; = @ [ ] ^ _ { | } ~



             For each of these characters, there  is  an  SGML  entity
             which  may be used to generate the ASCII character in the
             printed document, listed in table ??.  _U_s_u_a_l_l_y_,  _i_t  _w_i_l_l

                Ideally, it should be possible to hide the conventions
                of the underlying formatting  system  completely.   In
                fact,  SGML parsers which implement the full ISO stan­

             There are also three different kinds  of  dashes:  hyphen

          There are a large set of entities for other Western European
          languages.  Altogether, there are entities for almost all of
          the foreign language characters in ISO  8859,  the  Latin  1
          character set for Western European languages.2  ...

             Sentences  or phrases within paragraphs can be emphasized
          in a number of ways.  The em  tag  is  used  to  choose  the
          default  form of emphasis, which is usually _i_t_a_l_i_c type, but
          depends on the style of the background text.  If  the  back­
          ground  text  is formatted in italics type, as it usually is
          in definitions, for example, than emphasized  text  will  be
          formatted  using  a plain, roman typeface.  However, various

          forms of emphasis can be explicitly chosen.  These  include:
          bboolldd ffaaccee (bf), _i_t_a_l_i_c_s (it), sans serif (sf), _s_l_a_n_t_e_d (sl),
          and typewriter (tt) styles.


             Long quotes are formatted in LaTeX by indenting the  left
          and right margins.  For example, Lamport86 (pp. xiii):


                The  LaTeX document preparation system is a special
             version of Donald  Knuth's  TeX  program.   TeX  is  a
             sophisticated program designed to produce high-quality
             typesetting, especially for mathematical text.

                LaTeX represents a  balance  between  functionality
             and  ease  of  use.   Since  I  implemented most of it
             myself, there was also a continual compromise  between
             what  I  wanted to do and what I could do in a reason­
             able amount of time.  ...

          Three types of lists are supported, which  differ  according
          to  the  type  of  label used to mark each item in the list.
          Use itemize to create a list in which each  item  is  marked
          with  some  symbol such as a dash or bullet. The enum tag is
          used to create an enumeration, i.e. a  list  in  which  each
          item  is  labelled  with a number (or letter) indicating its
          rank or position in the list. Finally, use descrip to create
          a  list  in  which each item is labelled by some tag of your
          own choice. Lists of various types can nested.  For example:



          ·   A level one item.

          ·   Here's level two two

             1.  A level two item.

             2.  Here's level three:

                a.  A level three item.

                b.  Here's level four:

                   RReedd..
                       Is the color of my true love's hair.

                   BBlluuee..
                       Is a property of some movies.

          Encapsulated  PostScript  graphics  can  be  created using a
          variety of different editors.  If you are using Unix with an
          X11-based  graphical  user-interface,  you  may  want to try
          idraw, which stores its documents directly  as  Encapsulated
          PostScript files. Another interesting X11-based drawing pro­
          gram is tgif.


             Which would then appear as in figure ??.

          The original motivation behind the development of these doc­
          ument  types  was to create an environment for literate pro­
          gramming in an arbitrary  programming  language  similar  to
          Donald Knuth's WEB system for literate programming in Pascal
          Knuth84 .  ...

             When formatted, spaces and line breaks are preserved:


          main ()
          {
                  /* This is the famous hello world program */

                  printf("hello world\n");
          }

          The qwertz document types include  elements  for  describing
          mathematical formulas completely within SGML, similar to the
          system described in daphne89 .  ...
