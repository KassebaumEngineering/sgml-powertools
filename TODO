- use newer version of sgmls - sp 1.1.1.

- scripts for instantiating DTD and translation templates.

- . at beginning of line in groff 

- do we really need "expand $TABS"

- tables!

- maybe a global option for languages, expand the -g option for german on 
  sgml2latex to use alternate .sty files

- there has got to be a better option for A4 paper, maybe using <dina4>

- fix -man so it'll work for latin1, too

- check for .SGML and .sgml files in scripts
